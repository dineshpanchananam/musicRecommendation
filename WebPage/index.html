                    <p>Today’s internet users face an ever increasing amount of data, which makes it constantly harder and more time consuming to pick out the interesting pieces of information from all the noise. Intelligent filters in recommendation system can learn about the users’ preferences and figure out the most relevant information for them. With hundreds of songs and music being created every week, it will be interesting to implement a scalable recommender system that suggests songs of our taste which are rated high by other users.</p>

                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Overview of project</h2>
					<h3>Collaborative Filtering</h3>
					<p>One approach to the design of recommender systems that has wide use is collaborative filtering.Collaborative filtering methods are based on collecting and analyzing a large amount of information on users’ behaviors, activities or preferences and predicting what users will like based on their similarity to other users. A key advantage of the collaborative filtering approach is that it does not rely on machine analyzable content and therefore it is capable of accurately recommending complex items such as movies without requiring an "understanding" of the item itself. Many algorithms have been used in measuring user similarity or item similarity in recommender systems.</p>
					<h4>User-based Recommendation System</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Load User-rating dataset and then create normalize user vectors </li>
						<li>Find top 500 power users from a given dataset based on number of ratings given by user.</li>
						<li>For a logged-in user, find the cosine similarity between his ratings with power users  and come up with similarity vectors.</li>
						<li>Sort similarity vectors in descending order of similarity and come up with top N recommendations.</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Item-based Recommendation System</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Load user-rating dataset and obtain user-rating matrix (here choose random 500 ratings for each user).</li>
						<li>Find all item-item pair combos.</li>
						<li>Calculate the cosine similarity for each item pair and select the top N neighbours.</li>
						<li>Preprocess the item similarity matrix into a dictionary and store it as broadcast variable.</li>
						<li>For a logged-in user calculate top N item recommendations.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Content-based Recommendation System</h3>
					<p>A content based recommender works with data that the user provides, either explicitly (rating) or implicitly (clicking on a link). Based on that data, a user profile is generated, which is then used to make suggestions to the user. As the user provides more inputs or takes actions on the recommendations, the engine becomes more and more accurate.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Load user-rating dataset and for a logged-in user, find his history based on ratings he has given, let that Set be H.
						<li>Load Song-attribute dataset to read features viz., artist and genre.</li>
						<li>For a logged-in user U find TFIDF score for both artist and genre from his history set H.</li>
						<li>Based on TFIDF scores of feature, calculate score for each song from dataset.</li>
						</li>Sort all songs and show top N recommendations</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Algorithms /techniques/ Framework</h3>
						<p>Similarity-based Neighbourhood methods</p>	
						<p>Framework: Apache Spark</p>						
					<h3>Performance evaluation</h3>
						<h4>User-based Recommendation</h4>
						<p>O(n) where n  is number of songs</p>
						<h4>Content-based Recommendation</h4>
						<p>O(n) where n is number of songs</p>
						<h4>Item-based Recommendation</h4>
						<p>O(n^2) where n is number of items</p>

					<h3>Goals that will definitely be accomplish</h3>
					<p>Will provide a list of songs as a recommendation, based on similarity based neighborhood methods.  --Accomplished</p>
					<h3>Goals that may be accomplish</h3>
					<p>Involve user history along with the neighborhood methods in coming up with the recommendations. --Accomplished</p>
					<h3>Goals we will try to accomplish</h3>
					<p>Achieve linear scalability with growing user base and music data. --Accomplished</p>

					<h3>Additional comments and observations</h3>
						<h4>Challenges</h4>
						<p>Primarily for collaborative algorithms, quite a few approaches for computing initial user-item matrix had to be rejected considering in-memory execution in spark </p>
						<p>For item based collaborative algorithm, pairwise-item  comparision requires O(N^2) both space and time Complexity which put limitations on larger dataset.</p>
						<h4>Cool Enhancements</h4>
						<p>In User-based collaborative implementation, we have considered a set of 'Power Users'(Users with higher item-interaction).The ratings of these 'Power Users' are used to obtain similarity matrix with logged-in user. This helps in achieving Linear scalability.</p>
